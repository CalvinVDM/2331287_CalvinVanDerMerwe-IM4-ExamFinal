                    <h2>Essay - Net/Web Art</h2>
                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        For this essay, I have decided to look at the Electronic Literature collection as the web art that 
interests me most and that I think could relate to my website in a technical aspect as well as in terms 
of how it is conceptually and aesthetically. The website relates to my website in terms of the 
technical ideas I would like to implement and adapt as I think they would help me in terms of 
fleshing out a better internet art collection like the website’s ideas especially conceptually and the 
technicality of it.

                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        First, on the conceptual level, this website aims to be similar to a gallery and this works well in terms 
of the Renaissance style that I am aiming for especially because I wanted to create a page that could 
be used to show off many of the paintings and statues that belong in that era and so the use of the 
galley style would be useful in fulfilling that purpose and creating something that looks pleasing 
aesthetically but also provides information that further expands son artworks and the likes. It would 
also be a great idea to have the art improve over time and display the development and newer 
iterations of how this work has developed.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        As we can see in Figure 1 the homepage of the website is very simple and has nothing special but 
information about the collection and a link to each collection. In Figure 2 we see how the first 
volume of the website looks and we can see this collection of artworks formed together to create a 
collage of the artworks that looks fascinating but somewhat messy. I liked the idea of this in terms of 
its technical aspect because if one decides to, they can click on random things and get new results 
and explore cool and interesting works. Another thing I like is that the icons highlight as they are 
hovered upon and the big white block on the left displays the name of the artwork you are currently 
hovering on as well as the author as shown in Figure 3.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        The thing I don’t like about Volume 1 is how the aesthetics of the volume as it’s very plain and 
boring and according to Convention by Steven Mailloux conventions are known to be repeated or 
reoccurring practices (Mailloux, n.d.). So, this art piece breaks convention in terms of its menu which 
is beneath the artwork I don’t like this and think it makes the menu hard to see and harder to notice. 
I like the functionality of everything though as when you click on thinks you can see the mouse 
change to display what’s interactable and the convention of having menus that explain and detail 
things the main problem with the first Volume is its aesthetical practices as things are hard to read 
and strains the eyes to see and interact with.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        In volume 2 the main change is from the white space has the name and author changes and this 
version is also updated with newer art pieces and looks that show more things that are even 
downloadable. I like the idea of using the technical aspects for my website and I think that this style 
is very creative as it is internet art that reveals a collection of different art and allows you to interact 
with and even download this art for further research purposes. I think in the technical aspect I could 
use this and show off the paintings I have researched and link them in so that people can learn the 
history of these paintings similar to an art gallery. The creative aspect falls into how this art is shown 
in these block-like structures that all have more information attached to them and expand on click.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        As we see in Volume 3 of the electronic literature collection there is a complete revamp in 
aesthetics, and we see they removed the white block that gave information and instead use a more 
tuned-up search system to label things and allow users to see the art through this. We can see at the 
top of the page some headings allow the user to see a list of the art each with their unique 
specifications such as a keyword or author.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        In this version, we see that when we one a block it still comes with its individual information, but its 
aesthetical appeal is a lot larger and more defined. The words are a lot more legible and the colour 
scheme has changed drastically to allow for a more aesthetical appeal. Compared to the last two 
versions we can that this version is better to look at, explore as well as search in as now we can 
narrow down specific artworks a lot better. This version uses a more centrally-heavy style according 
to the UX practices of Peta Goldberg (Goldberg, n.d.). we also see that the colour theory breaks 
through a lot more in this version as now we see a website with more structure in terms of its 
content and appeal as well as more structure looks and even conventions when coming to the use of 
heading and headers. 
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        The website’s logic is a lot better as now there is also a return button at the top of the screen so that 
we can return to the main page. The information is a lot less overwhelming now as they are now 
packaged into boxes with headings and subheadings to fully take advantage of the nature of reading. 
this looks more stylised like a Microsoft Word document which helps because now the user can 
follow the flow of logic and write a lot better. One thing that’s major for me is the balance between 
aesthetics and functionality that we can now get from the website. I think that the conceptualisation 
of the idea was always good but rather the execution was lacking and needed more attention to be 
able to compete. We also see the use of colour theory (Interaction Design Foundation, n.d.) and how 
the colours of each object on the screen follow an order and are used to ease up strain on the eye. 
We also see the actual use of the logo in the title of the tab and we see how the keyword menu is 
more fleshed out and is useful. 
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        This is a cool listing of the artworks and authors as it shows them in a very professional format that 
allows the user to sort through them in the best way possible. I think that the concept is cool as with 
this listing by clicking on any keyword the list will filter to show only the users with those specific 
keywords attached to the art and this allows the user to filter out and look for specifics. Aesthetically 
I think this page could look better in terms of the aesthetics. My idea specifically for this page would 
be to put it in a table format or at the very least section it off more between each piece. This would 
make it so that the whole thing doesn’t look like one big list with many words which would aid in the 
readability of the list. But I think that technically and conceptually this version is great and is almost 
perfect. Another thing cool about this page is the fact that the keywords have a definition at the top 
that gives further insight into what each of the keywords entails in terms of the artwork.

                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        One thing I don’t like is that all these keywords are on a single page and so the keyword acts as a 
hyperlink to the section of this keyword it would be better if the keyword has a generated list 
attached toit that opens a page with the information. This would entail JavaScript, but it would be 
better in terms of design look and feel for the webpage. This website also has other filters that 
includes language, author, and country so this is also a good way to specify the artworks better, but 
the main problem is that they follow the format of the keywords where everything is on one page. 
Lastly, I like the title page as it gives insight to the website’s creation and its references, editors and 
other information involving the development of the site.

                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        The fourth volume of the Electronic Literature Collection shows the absolute peak of the 
development of the website in the best ways. Firstly, the aesthetical feel and look of the website is 
exquisite and looks good when compared to its predecessors. one thing that I do miss is the collage 
style that the previous version had but at the same time the newer version looks better in terms of 
readability and view as one can see what they are clicking on a lot better.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        The intractability of the fourth volume is amazing as when one hovers on an artwork the heading 
changes in the header as we see in Figure 6 and 7 and the bubble that contained the artworks 
changes to show begin this is a lot more user friendly as it make the user more comfortable and it 
give more meaning and look to the users choices and view of the page as it changes with the users 
interest. The name of said artwork and its author is also more visible in the header then when it was 
placed anywhere else
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        As we can see in Figure 8 the glossary was expanded upon in the best way possible as it is section off 
and a lot more specific in terms of the keywords and what heading these keywords fall under. There 
is also a lot more keywords and the keyword show how many artworks are attached to each of 
them. This gives the user control over what they are searching for with profound accuracy. The 
amount of keywords are a bit overwhelming in terms of sheer number and look but I think that in 
this version they wanted to give more option and tried to make the keywords look at readable as 
possible.

                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        Aesthetically the index page looks a lot better and more fleshed out. The words are more readable, 
and they are sectioned of as I mentioned in Volume 3 which shows how far the website has come in 
terms of development. I like the fact that in the index we have more options to filter and look 
through everything we want, and we can also zoom in on specific things we want. This page is 
extremely long though and it can be a pain to scroll through as it goes far down, I would suggest 
sectioning of once more and have and index page 1 and 2 to limit the amount the user scrolls down 
immensely. I really like the aesthetics applied but I think that the page can still look better but 
overall, it is the biggest improvement.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        The about page gives a lot of information and still looks very good fitting the rest of the website’s 
aesthetics. I like that you can track progress and look through the development of the website well.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "blog1_text">
                        To conclude I really enjoyed the experience this website gives and like seeing the development the 
website had over the years and it shows me that one is never truly done working on their website as 
there is always better things and newer ways to improve. This website has also given me many ideas 
for my own and I think that to anyone this websites progress and influence and be a great asset.
