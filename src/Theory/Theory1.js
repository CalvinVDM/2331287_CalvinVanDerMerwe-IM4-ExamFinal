                  <p class = "blog1_text">
				This time around I tried to go for a theme that I could make very pleasing aesthetically. I tried to make my website not harsh on the eye and yet still had an artistic influence and feel that brought the website together in a seemingly artistic way. The main theme of the website is that of art, but I tried to focus on the Renaissance specifically as I believe that in that period art was in its most beautiful and stylish form.
			
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				The Renaissance was an art period that took place between the 14th and 17th centuries, and it had a massive influence on European culture, art and pollical and economic views. The art coming out at this period is some of the most famous artworks known today and so I thought that by using this aesthetic and feel I could breathe a new life into my website through artistic creation.
			
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				The main feeling and experience of my website are that of a museum as the background of the website is comprised of artworks from this period therefore in a way it displays these pieces in a seamless way that follows the flow of the website as well as its theme. The UI of the website comprises a header and footer with sections in between them. These sections are defined by the background images that flow from one to the other as one continues through the website. 
			
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Each section has its content that relates to art in some way shape or form, and it plays with the sense of attraction that the eyes have. All the tabs of the website appear at the top of the website in the header and show all the available tabs that one may access. The footer appears when one reaches the end of the webpage and so displays that the content of the pages is finished. It is also trademarked by a heading. On the index page is also a sign-up sheet I thought of using this as an emailing system so that the website could email information about historic pieces of art and the context behind them so that users could sign up for a day-to-day tour discovering new works.

			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				The blog section consists of a main page that has cards that may access each of the blog posts that I have up and running. In each blog at the end of the blog, some buttons may take the user to the next or previous blog in the line I did this to create a seamless transition between the posts and to allow the user to backtrack as they, please. The theory section is comprised very similar to this.

			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				The design section houses the wireframes as scroll-throughs that allows the user to follow and flow through each wireframe by scrolling and it shows cool thinking and imagery for the user. I tried to be very accurate and forthcoming with my design process and tried to make it so that the user could see the steps it took me to create this website.

			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Lastly, the Internet art section deals with art in a very interesting way as it uses the theme and explores the boundaries between the digital web and the artistic sense.  It will be the most complicated part of the website by far, but I think that with enough effort and motivation, I will be able to figure it out.

			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Overall, I think that the user experience is quite interesting and feels good and I do think that the UI and UX complement each other to create and thriving and unique experience.
